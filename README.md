### Name / Title of the Project: 
Churn Prediction for a Telecom Company
### Statement about the Problem:
The telecom industry faces significant challenges in retaining customers, with many customers switching to competitors. This issue, known as customer churn, directly impacts revenue and growth. The goal of this project is to predict which customers are likely to leave the service, allowing the company to implement retention strategies proactively.

Methodology:
### Data Collection: 
Customer usage patterns, billing history, demographics, and interactions.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, scale features, encode variables.
### Model Development: 
Use algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
### Evaluation:
 Measure performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
### Tools and Technologies:
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, MySQL, Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, Git/GitHub.
